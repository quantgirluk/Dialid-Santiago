  Hello, world!

<!-- this is a subheadline -->

I am **Dialid Santiago**, also known as **_Quant Girl_** ‚Äîa mathematician with nine years of experience working 
as a Quant (short for Financial Quantitative Analyst). I currently work in the Cross-Asset Front Office Quant team 
at **Bank of America**. Over the course of my career, I‚Äôve had the opportunity 
to collaborate with diverse teams at institutions like **Citigroup**, **Barclays**, and **The Co-operative Bank**, 
contributing to a wide range of projects across the financial industry.

My work focuses on designing and implementing mathematical models to price financial instruments and manage risk 
across a broad range of asset classes, including Equities, Credit, Commodities, and Rates.

I hold a **PhD in Statistics** from the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/), where I
spent four exciting years researching non-linear stochastic processes. Prior to that, I earned an M.Sc. in Probability and Statistics and a B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics.

I‚Äôm passionate about **turning academic research into practical tools that solve real problems in finance**. I also 
have a strong interest in **data visualization** and use it extensively to communicate complex concepts 
clearly and reveal meaningful insights.

Last but certainly not least‚ÄîI‚Äôm a proud **mom** to a spirited toddler ‚ù§Ô∏è who keeps me on my toes and fills most of my so-called "free" time. 
When I do get a quiet moment, I enjoy building open-source tools and writing here.
