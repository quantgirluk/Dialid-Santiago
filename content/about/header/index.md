  Hello, world!

<!-- this is a subheadline -->

I am **Dialid Santiago**, a mathematician with nine years of experience working as a Quant (short for Financial Quantitative Analyst).

My work focuses on formulating and implementing mathematical models to price financial instruments and manage risk across 
a variety of asset classes—including Equities, Credit, Commodities, and Rates.

I earned a PhD in Statistics from the University of Warwick, where I spent four exciting years 
researching non-linear stochastic processes. Before moving to the UK 🇬🇧, I studied in Mexico 🇲🇽, where 
I completed an M.Sc. in Probability and Statistics and a B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics.

I’m passionate about turning academic research into practical tools that solve real problems in finance. I also love data visualisation and use it in nearly every project to communicate complex ideas and uncover powerful insights.


Last but certainly not least—I’m also a mom to a spirited toddler ❤️ who keeps me on my toes and fills most of my so-called "free" time. 
When I do get a quiet moment, I enjoy building open-source tools and writing about financial mathematics, programming, 
statistics, and data visualisation.
