  I created this website as a kind of digital notebookâ€”a place to collect and share my thoughts, notes, and insights on topics I care about, mainly around mathematics, programming, finance, and my experience working as a quant.
  
  This site follows the philosophy of a **digital garden** ðŸª´, a concept that offers an alternative to the traditional blog. In a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/), ideas are treated like living things: theyâ€™re planted, nurtured, and allowed to grow over time. Instead of focusing on publishing polished, time-stamped articles, a digital garden encourages ongoing exploration, note-taking, and iterative writing.   
  This approach feels especially fitting for subjects like mathematics and finance, where learning is rarely linear and insights often build gradually over time.
    
  This site is intentionally simpleâ€”no ads, no tracking, no sponsored content, and no paywalls â€”because I believe educational content should be freely accessible and, whenever possible, open source.
